# Flow Builder

The flow builder is where you design your USSD application logic.

## Creating a Flow

1. From the dashboard, click **New Flow**
2. Enter a name and optional description
3. Click **Create**

You'll be taken to an empty canvas ready for design.

## Canvas Navigation

### Pan

- **Mouse**: Hold `Space` and drag
- **Trackpad**: Two-finger scroll

### Zoom

- **Mouse**: Scroll wheel
- **Trackpad**: Pinch gesture
- **Buttons**: Use `+` and `-` in the bottom-right corner

### Fit to View

Press `F` or click the "Fit" button to center all nodes in view.

## Building Your Flow

### Step 1: Add the Start Node

Every flow needs a starting point:

1. Add a **Menu** or **Display** node
2. Right-click → **Set as Start Node**
3. The node shows a green "Start" badge

### Step 2: Add More Nodes

Build out your flow by adding nodes:

```
[Start: Menu] → [Input] → [Action] → [Display] → [End]
```

### Step 3: Connect Nodes

Create the flow path:

1. Click the output port (right side of node)
2. Drag to the input port (left side of target node)
3. Release to connect

### Step 4: Configure Each Node

Click a node to open its properties:

- Set the content/message
- Configure options (for menus)
- Set variable names (for inputs)
- Add conditions (for branches)

## Working with Connections

### Creating Connections

- Click and drag from output to input ports
- Menu nodes have multiple outputs (one per option)
- Other nodes typically have one output

### Deleting Connections

- Click on a connection line
- Press `Delete` or `Backspace`

### Reconnecting

- Drag the connection endpoint to a new node
- Or delete and create a new connection

## Node Operations

### Selecting

- **Single**: Click on a node
- **Multiple**: `Shift + Click` or drag a selection box
- **All**: `Cmd/Ctrl + A`

### Moving

- Drag selected nodes to reposition
- Use arrow keys for precise movement

### Duplicating

- `Cmd/Ctrl + D` to duplicate selected nodes
- Connections within the selection are preserved

### Deleting

- Select nodes and press `Delete`
- Or right-click → **Delete**

## Flow Organization

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names:

```
Good: "main-menu", "get-phone-number", "confirm-transfer"
Bad: "node1", "menu", "x"
```

### Layout Tips

- Keep the flow left-to-right or top-to-bottom
- Group related nodes together
- Use consistent spacing
- Add comments for complex sections

### Comments

Add notes to your flow:

1. Right-click on canvas
2. Select **Add Comment**
3. Enter your note

Comments are visible only in the editor.

## Version History

Studio auto-saves your work and maintains version history:

1. Click **History** in the toolbar
2. Browse previous versions by timestamp
3. Click to preview
4. **Restore** to revert to that version

<Warning>
  Restoring a version overwrites current changes. Make sure to save first if needed.
</Warning>

## Collaboration

### Sharing

Share your flow with team members:

1. Click **Share** in the toolbar
2. Add collaborators by email
3. Set permissions (View, Edit, Admin)

### Permissions

| Role | Can View | Can Edit | Can Deploy | Can Delete |
|------|----------|----------|------------|------------|
| Viewer | Yes | No | No | No |
| Editor | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Admin | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

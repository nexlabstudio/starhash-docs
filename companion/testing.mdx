# Testing on Device

This guide covers testing your USSD flows on real mobile devices using the Companion app.

## Test Modes

### Interactive Testing

The default mode - manually navigate through your flow:

1. Open a flow
2. Tap **Start Test**
3. Enter responses using the keypad
4. Observe each screen

### Scenario Testing

Run predefined test scenarios:

1. Open a flow
2. Tap **Scenarios**
3. Select a scenario
4. Watch the flow execute automatically

Create scenarios in Studio under **Flow Settings** → **Test Scenarios**.

## Testing Best Practices

### Test All Paths

Ensure every node is reachable:

- [ ] All menu options lead somewhere
- [ ] Error paths are handled
- [ ] Back/cancel works correctly
- [ ] End nodes display properly

### Test Edge Cases

Verify behavior with unexpected input:

| Input | Expected Behavior |
|-------|-------------------|
| Empty | Show error or re-prompt |
| Invalid | Show error message |
| Too long | Truncate or reject |
| Special chars | Handle gracefully |

### Test Timing

USSD has strict timing requirements:

- Sessions timeout after ~3 minutes
- Responses must be under 30 seconds
- Test with realistic delays

### Test Character Limits

USSD screens are limited to 182 characters:

- Check that all screens fit
- Verify truncation doesn't break meaning
- Test with maximum-length user input

## Variable Inspection

While testing, inspect variable values:

1. Start a test session
2. Tap the **Variables** icon (top right)
3. See all current variable values
4. Modify values for testing

### Override Variables

Test specific scenarios by overriding variables:

1. Tap on a variable
2. Enter a new value
3. Continue testing

Example: Set `balance` to `0` to test insufficient funds path.

## Session Recording

Record sessions for debugging or sharing:

### Enable Recording

1. Before starting a test, tap **Record**
2. Complete your test session
3. Tap **Stop Recording**

### View Recordings

1. Go to **History** → **Recordings**
2. Select a recording
3. Playback the session

### Share Recordings

1. Open a recording
2. Tap **Share**
3. Send via email, Slack, etc.

## Mock API Responses

When flows call external APIs, use mock responses:

### Set Up Mocks

1. In Studio, go to the Action node
2. Under **Test**, add mock responses
3. Mocks sync to the Companion app

### Enable/Disable Mocks

In the Companion app:

1. Open flow settings
2. Toggle **Use Mock Data**
3. Select which mocks to use

### Mock Scenarios

Create multiple mock scenarios:

| Scenario | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| Success | Happy path testing |
| API Error | Error handling |
| Timeout | Slow response handling |
| Empty | No data scenarios |

## Multi-Device Testing

Test the same flow on multiple devices simultaneously:

### Setup

1. Install the Companion app on multiple devices
2. Sign in to the same account on all devices
3. Open the same flow

### Synchronized Testing

Start tests at the same time to:

- Compare behavior across devices
- Test concurrent sessions
- Verify consistency

## Debugging

### View Request Details

For Action nodes that make API calls:

1. During testing, tap the **Debug** icon
2. See the request URL, headers, body
3. View the response data

### Error Details

When an error occurs:

1. An error screen appears
2. Tap **View Details**
3. See the full error message and stack trace

### Report Issues

If you find a bug:

1. Tap **Report Issue**
2. The current session state is captured
3. Add a description
4. Submit to your team

## Comparison with Production

After deploying, compare test vs production:

| Aspect | Companion | Production |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Network | WiFi/Mobile | Telecom |
| Timeout | Flexible | ~30 seconds |
| Session | Simulated | Real |
| Costs | Free | Carrier charges |

<Warning>
  Companion testing doesn't fully replicate production conditions. Always test with real shortcodes before launch.
</Warning>

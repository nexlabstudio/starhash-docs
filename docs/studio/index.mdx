## Interface

The Studio interface consists of four main areas:

### 1. Toolbar

Located at the top, the toolbar provides quick access to:

- **Save** - Save your flow
- **Undo/Redo** - Revert or restore changes
- **Test** - Open the simulator
- **Deploy** - Publish to production
- **Settings** - Flow configuration

### 2. Node Palette

On the left side, you'll find all available node types:

- Menu nodes
- Input nodes
- Display nodes
- Branch nodes
- Action nodes
- End nodes

Drag nodes from the palette onto the canvas.

### 3. Canvas

The main working area where you design your flow. Here you can:

- Drag and drop nodes
- Connect nodes with arrows
- Select and configure nodes
- Pan and zoom the view

### 4. Properties Panel

On the right side, configure the selected node:

- Node name and ID
- Content and messages
- Variables and expressions
- Connections to other nodes

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + S` | Save flow |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Z` | Undo |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z` | Redo |

## Working with Nodes

### Adding Nodes

1. **Drag and drop** from the node palette
2. **Right-click** on the canvas → Add Node
3. **Double-click** on the canvas

### Connecting Nodes

1. Hover over a node's output port (right side)
2. Click and drag to the target node's input port
3. Release to create the connection

### Configuring Nodes

## Flow Validation

Studio validates your flow in real-time:

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Missing start node | No node is marked as the start |
| Orphan nodes | Nodes not connected to the flow |
| Missing connections | Required outputs not connected |
| Invalid expressions | Syntax errors in variables |

Fix validation errors before deploying.

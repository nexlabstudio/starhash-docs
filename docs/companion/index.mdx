# Companion App

The StarHash Companion app lets you test USSD flows on real mobile devices before deploying to production.

## Why Use the Companion App?

The web simulator is great for development, but testing on a real device gives you:

- **Authentic experience** - See exactly what your users will see
- **Device testing** - Test across different phone models
- **Offline behavior** - Verify how flows handle network issues
- **Touch interaction** - Experience the real keypad input flow

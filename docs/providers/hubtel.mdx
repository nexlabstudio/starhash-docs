## Mobile Money Integration

Hubtel excels at mobile money integration:

### Payment Prompts

Trigger mobile money payments from Action nodes:

```json
{
  "actionType": "hubtel_payment",
  "config": {
    "amount": "${amount}",
    "phone": "${phone}",
    "description": "Payment for service"
  }
}
```

### Payment Status

Check payment status in your flow using a Branch node:

| Condition | Then go to |
|-----------|------------|
| `paymentStatus == "success"` | Payment Success node |
| (default) | Payment Failed node |

## Best Practices

1. **Shorter flows** - Hubtel has 2-minute timeout
2. **Handle Release** - Gracefully end when user cancels
3. **Use ClientState** - Persist data between requests
4. **Integrate payments** - Leverage Hubtel's payment APIs

# USSD Providers

StarHash works with major USSD providers across Africa. Connect your shortcode to start receiving live traffic.

## How It Works

1. **Get a shortcode** from your chosen provider
2. **Configure credentials** in StarHash
3. **Set the callback URL** in your provider's dashboard
4. **Deploy your flow** to start receiving traffic

```
User dials *123# → Provider → StarHash → Your Flow → Response → User
```

## Choosing a Provider

Consider these factors when choosing a provider:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Coverage** | Which countries/networks do you need? |
| **Pricing** | Per-session costs vary by provider |
| **Shortcode type** | Shared vs dedicated shortcodes |
| **API reliability** | Uptime and latency |
| **Support** | Quality of technical support |

## Shortcode Types

### Shared Shortcode

- Lower cost
- Format: `*123*45#` (with suffix)
- Shared with other services
- Good for testing and small-scale

### Dedicated Shortcode

- Higher cost
- Format: `*123#` (no suffix)
- Exclusive to your service
- Required for serious applications

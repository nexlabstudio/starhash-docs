# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about StarHash and USSD development.

## General

### What is StarHash?

StarHash is a visual platform for building USSD applications. Instead of writing complex callback handlers, you design flows visually and StarHash handles execution, session management, and provider integration.

### What is USSD?

USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) is a protocol used by mobile phones to communicate with service providers in real-time. It's commonly used for mobile banking, airtime top-up, and information services across Africa.

### Which countries does StarHash support?

StarHash works with providers in:
- Kenya
- Nigeria
- Ghana
- Uganda
- Tanzania

More countries are added based on provider availability.

### Do I need to know how to code?

No! StarHash's visual editor lets you build complete USSD applications without writing code. However, if you want to integrate with external APIs, basic understanding of APIs is helpful.

## Flows & Building

### How many nodes can a flow have?

There's no hard limit, but we recommend keeping flows under 50 nodes for maintainability. Complex applications should be split into multiple flows.

### Can I duplicate a flow?

Yes! In the dashboard, click the menu (⋮) on any flow and select **Duplicate**.

### Can I import/export flows?

Yes, flows can be exported as JSON:
1. Open a flow
2. Go to **Settings** → **Export**
3. Download the JSON file

Import by creating a new flow and selecting **Import**.

### Can multiple people edit the same flow?

Yes, with Pro and Enterprise plans. Go to **Share** to invite team members. Real-time collaboration is coming soon.

## Deployment

### How do I get a USSD shortcode?

Contact one of our supported providers:
- [Africa's Talking](https://africastalking.com)
- [Hubtel](https://hubtel.com)
- [Arkesel](https://arkesel.com)
- [Nalo Solutions](https://nalosolutions.com)

They'll assign you a shortcode (dedicated or shared).

### Can I deploy to multiple providers?

Yes! Create separate instances for each provider. The same flow can be deployed to multiple providers simultaneously.

### How quickly do changes go live?

Changes are live immediately after clicking **Publish**. There's no delay or propagation time.

### Can I roll back a deployment?

Yes! Go to **Instance** → **Versions** to see version history and roll back to any previous version.

---

## Testing

### How do I test without a real shortcode?

Use the built-in simulator in Studio. It mimics real USSD sessions without needing a shortcode or incurring costs.

### Does testing cost money?

No! Simulator testing is free. Only production traffic incurs charges from your USSD provider.

---

## Technical

### What happens if my API is slow?

USSD providers have strict timeouts (usually 20-30 seconds). If your API takes too long:
1. The session may timeout
2. Users see an error message

Optimize API calls or use caching for slow endpoints.

### How are sessions stored?

Sessions are stored securely in our infrastructure. Session data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Data retention depends on your plan:
- Free: 7 days
- Pro: 90 days
- Enterprise: Custom

### Is my data secure?

Yes. We use:
- TLS 1.3 for all connections
- AES-256 encryption at rest
- SOC 2 Type II compliance (Enterprise)
- Regular security audits

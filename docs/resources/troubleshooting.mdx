# Troubleshooting

Solutions to common problems you might encounter.

## Flow Builder Issues

### Can't add nodes to the canvas

**Symptoms**: Clicking "Add Node" does nothing, or nodes don't appear.

**Solutions**:
1. Refresh the page
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)
4. Disable browser extensions that might interfere

### Connections won't save

**Symptoms**: Node connections disappear after saving.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure both nodes are properly placed on canvas
2. Check that connection is between output → input (not input → input)
3. Verify you have edit permissions

### Flow won't save

**Symptoms**: Error message when saving, or changes are lost.

**Solutions**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Look for validation errors (red indicators)
3. Ensure flow has a start node
4. Try saving again after a few seconds

---

## Deployment Issues

### "No start node" error

**Cause**: Every flow needs a designated starting point.

**Solution**:
1. Right-click on the first node
2. Select **Set as Start Node**
3. Look for the green "Start" badge

### "Orphan nodes detected" error

**Cause**: Some nodes aren't connected to the main flow.

**Solution**:
1. Click **Validate** to highlight orphan nodes
2. Connect them to the flow or delete them
3. All nodes must be reachable from the start node

### "Invalid callback URL" from provider

**Cause**: The callback URL isn't configured correctly.

**Solution**:
1. Copy the exact URL from StarHash (**Instance** → **Settings**)
2. Ensure no trailing slashes or spaces
3. Make sure you're using HTTPS
4. Verify the instance ID is correct

### Deployment says "success" but flow doesn't work

**Causes**:
- Provider callback not configured
- Wrong environment (sandbox vs production)
- Flow has logic errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify callback URL in provider dashboard
2. Check you're using production credentials
3. Test in the simulator first

## Session Issues

### Sessions timing out

**Cause**: USSD sessions expire after 2-3 minutes of inactivity.

**Solutions**:
1. Keep flows concise (fewer steps)
2. Reduce API call times
3. Use clear prompts so users respond quickly
4. This is normal USSD behavior - design accordingly

### Sessions not appearing in dashboard

**Cause**: Sessions may be filtered or delayed.

**Solutions**:
1. Check date filters
2. Refresh the page
3. Sessions appear within 1 minute
4. Verify the correct instance is selected

### "Session not found" errors

**Cause**: Session expired or invalid session ID.

**Solutions**:
1. Sessions expire after ~3 minutes
2. Check if provider is sending correct session ID
3. Review webhook logs for details

## API & Webhook Issues

### API calls failing in Action nodes

**Symptoms**: Action node shows error, flow stops.

**Debugging steps**:
1. Open the session in X-Ray view
2. Check the API request/response details
3. Verify the API URL is correct
4. Check API credentials

**Common causes**:
- Incorrect URL
- Authentication failure
- API timeout (>30 seconds)
- Invalid response format

### Webhooks not receiving traffic

**Symptoms**: No sessions appear, provider shows errors.

**Debugging steps**:
1. Check callback URL is correct
2. Verify instance is active (not paused)
3. Check provider dashboard for error logs
4. Try the health endpoint:
   ```
   curl https://api.starhash.dev/health
   ```

### "Unauthorized" webhook errors

**Cause**: Invalid or missing API credentials.

**Solution**:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Providers**
2. Re-enter your API credentials
3. Save and redeploy

## Performance Issues

### Flows running slowly

**Causes**:
- Slow external API calls
- Complex flow logic
- High traffic volume

**Solutions**:
1. Optimize API endpoints
2. Add caching for repeated data
3. Simplify flow paths
4. Contact support for scaling options

### Dashboard loading slowly

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try incognito/private mode
4. Use Chrome for best performance

## Account Issues

### Can't reset password

**Solutions**:
1. Check spam folder for reset email
2. Ensure correct email address
3. Wait 5 minutes and try again
4. Contact support@starhash.dev

### Team member can't access flows

**Cause**: Incorrect permissions.

**Solution**:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Team**
2. Check their role (Viewer, Editor, Admin)
3. Ensure they're on the correct workspace
